				<p><b>Mitsubishi 3000GT</b></p>
				<p>The Mitsubishi 3000GT car in the first generation was produced from 1990 to 1993, in the second from 1994 to 1996 and in the third from 1997 to 2000. The models of the early 90s were the most technologically advanced: electrically controlled shock absorbers, all four wheels could turn, automatic adjustment of the angle of attack of the spoiler. The latter option is still rare. Manufacturability had significant drawbacks - high price, increased weight, cars often broke down. To reduce the number of breakdowns in subsequent modifications, they abandoned some options, continuing to improve dynamics. The legendary car can be seen in Jackie Chan's films, including "Stormbreaker". It was also remembered by many for the popular "Turbo" inserts.</p>

				<p><b>Mitsubishi Eclipse</b></p>
				<p>The Mitsubishi Eclipse series was created for the American market in conjunction with Chrysler. The first and second generation of the sports coupe were produced between 1989-1994 and 1995-1999. Despite the joint production with the Americans, the car received a Japanese design. Among collectors and lovers of classic cars, the second generation of the Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX sports car is more appreciated. The cars were used for filming the films Fast and Furious 1 and Fast and Furious 2.</p>

				<p><b>Mitsubishi Evo VI</b></p>
				<p>The Mitsubishi Evo VI series was produced between 1996 and 1997. This is a limited edition with legendary looks that are recognizable among sports cars around the world. A feature of the line is the increased reliability of the engine, equipped with titanium-aluminum turbines. The series includes several unique, limited-edition versions, one of which is named after Finnish driver Tommi MÃ¤kinen. He has won four WRC racing championships while driving a Mitsubishi.</p>

				<p><b>Mitsubishi GTO</b></p>
				<p>Mitsubishi GTO cars remain in history as one of the revolutionaries of the serial automotive industry. They were produced in the period from 1990 to 2000. Thanks to these cars, a combination of an all-wheel drive and an engine with two turbines was launched into mass production. In the updates since 1993, hidden headlights have been abandoned.</p>

				<p><b>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution</b></p>
				<p>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution in the 90s was marked as one of the most famous and multi-series Japanese cars. It's not about the number of units produced, but about the modifications. Between 1992 and 1999, there were seven generations of the sports car. Each of them remained in the hearts and memory of fans, showing a phased evolution of a whole decade. It is important to add that the worldwide popularity of the series began with the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo III. Assembly machines VI starred in the movie "Fast and the Furious 2" and "Taxi".</p>
