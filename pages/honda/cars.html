				<p><b>Honda Accord</b></p>
				<p>In the period of the 90s (from 1989 to 1998), the Honda Accord was released in three generations, each of which was remembered in history as a reliable, functional and technological car. In the United States, the car was one of the first to be equipped with a revolutionary technology in headlights - optical reflectors with clear lenses. At the same time, Japanese assemblies were distinguished by unique options. Among them are automatic climate control systems and electric seats, which are not available in all trim levels, even in modern cars. The legendary 1988 Honda Accord has left its mark on the culture, taking part in the filming of the cult films "Taxi".</p>

				<p><b>Honda Civic</b></p>
				<p>In the TOP of Japanese cars of the 90s, the Honda Civic takes pride of place thanks to the fifth and sixth generations, produced between 1991-1995 and 1996-1999. These models perfectly continue the original concept of balanced performance and high reliability. The confirmation is their popularity on the roads even in 2020. Many moviegoers remember these cars from the movie "Fast and the Furious 1".</p>

				<p><b>Honda CRX</b></p>
				<p>The iconic Honda CRX has gained popularity since the second generation, produced between 1987 and 1991. It was a lightweight compact sports car with an original look and a large rear window. It attracted everyone with its exclusivity and dynamic silhouette, as well as balanced technical characteristics. The success of this modification culminated in the lightweight sports car category.</p>

				<p><b>Honda NSX</b></p>
				<p>The stylish Honda NSX first went on sale in 1990. It was developed as an alternative to European sports cars. To obtain competitive characteristics, the latest technologies of that time were implemented in it. These include a high-revving engine with titanium connecting rods and a proprietary variable valve timing system. The NSX also became the first production car with an all-aluminum body. The car was attracted for the filming of the movie "Fast and the Furious 4", and then its photo was adorned with the inserts of the "Turbo" gum.</p>

				<p><b>Honda S2000</b></p>
				<p>The Honda S2000 Roadster was produced from 1999 to 2009. The most valuable among collectors is the first generation, whose design and equipment were on the verge of two eras. The legend of the Japanese car industry left a noticeable mark in history thanks to the F20C engine, which set the world record for the number of revolutions among the serial motors of its group, "spinning" up to almost 9000 rpm. Perhaps that is why the roadster took part in the filming of the films Fast and Furious 1 and Fast and Furious 2.</p>
